    "bio": "Hello! My name is Joshua, im currently 23 years old and attending college for computer science. I have been serving my country and state through the Army National Guard over the past 5 years. Currently I'm working for the Washington State Military Department providing technical support and assistance in synergy for daily operations. During my service I have gained a plethora of skills such as; leadership, perseverance, time management, communication & teamwork and so many more. These are valuable skills and I plan on building my software development career on that foundation. While theres always room for progress and improvement, I consider myself a Full Stack ReactJS Developer. I started coding along with Youtube tutorials years ago in middle school and decided that coding is something I wouldn't mind doing for life.",
